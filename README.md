Hi! Thanks for trying out my game!

This game was made as a final project for a college class, and is also the first game I've ever made. 

This means the game isn't quite in tip-top shape, but it was defenitly a labor of love to make for my class so I will be improving it and
providing updated versions whenever I do. 

Up to this point, this game took roughly 30 hours to make, including coding and making assets, which I think is decent considering I only
started programming about a year ago and this game was my first time using C#.

Anyway, thanks again for trying this game, I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it :)



Description:
Play as a wizard trying to defeat a big monster before they can destroy all the magic pillars, dooming you. You can move left and right
accross the bottom of the window using A and D, and press Space to cast spells. There are 2 types of spells you can cast, Regular Spells
and Super Spells. You can only cast a ceratin number of Regular Spells at a time, and these spells will only effect the minions
continuously coming at you. Cast spells at the minions to keep them away from you, and after defeating a certain number of minions
your Super Spell will be charged and can be activated by pressing E. Control transfers to the super spell once you activate it and you
must navigate it towards the big monster, the Super Spell being the only magic that can affect them. Land enough hits with Super Spells
on the big monster before they destroy all the pillars to defeat them and win the game.
